# Quantum Portfolio

The origin of this project was extension on a project in a senior physics course *PHYS 4315: Introduction to Quantum Computing*, which is crosslisted as a masters course in electrical engineering *ECE 5332: Special Topics in Electrical Engineering*. The majority of the background and coursework was from the text ***Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing*** by Thomas G. Wong. The text explores classical computing and its quantum counterparts. This leads into the eventual work of Nielsen and Chuang's ***Quantum Computation and Quantum Information***, which we covered sections of along with some of Schr√∂dinger's equation for algorithmic preparation.

This is a brief overview of differences in the classical and quantum, listed from Wong's text.

# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm

## Solving a Network

The way I understood this to work was to consider nodes as representing each asset in a set, where the edges could represent items from covariance to high-correlation or other ways assets may be connected. The QAOA is best in this case as we can then consider a MaxCut problem, which I primarily learned from [here](https://www.mustythoughts.com/quantum-approximate-optimization-algorithm-explained).
