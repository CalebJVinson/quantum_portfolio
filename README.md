# Quantum Portfolio

The origin of this project was extension on a project in a senior physics course *PHYS 4315: Introduction to Quantum Computing*, which is crosslisted as a masters course in electrical engineering *ECE 5332: Special Topics in Electrical Engineering*. The majority of the background and coursework was from the text ***Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing*** by Thomas G. Wong. The text explores classical computing and its quantum counterparts. This leads into the eventual work of Nielsen and Chuang's ***Quantum Computation and Quantum Information***, which we covered sections of along with some of schr \"{o}dinger's equation.
